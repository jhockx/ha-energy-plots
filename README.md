# Home Assistant Energy Plots
This Home Assistant addon serves plots made with InfluxDB data, Pandas and Plotly for electricity, solar and gas data.

*Note for developing: Keep a good eye on EOL settings. This should be Linux (LF) and not Windows (CRLF)! Settings can become corrupt in Home Assistant if you use CRLF.*
