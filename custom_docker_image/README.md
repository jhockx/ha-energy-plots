# Build custom Docker image
Installing Python, Pip and a few packages takes a very long time on the Raspberry Pi. Therefore a Dockerfile was made and the corresponding image was uploaded to Dockerhub to reduce build times. To actually build the image and push to Dockerhub, you need the ARM architecture of the Raspberry Pi. For this, a Raspberry Pi 4B was used. Just [download the imager for Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), format the SD card with this software to a FAT filesystem and install the Rasberry Pi OS Lite (= a headless OS). To acces the headless Pi over SSH, copy the files in the folder `headless_pi_setup` to the boot partition.
